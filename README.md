# Weather App
a weather app pulling information from the OpenWeather API. In the future it would be good to allow some kind of 'Find my Location' and alter backgrounds to fit weather moods

ICEBOX:

 - [] Add some kind of 'near me' button to bypass typing for relative local weather
 - [] Adjust page backgrounds to relative weather "moods"
 - [] some kind of map view incorporating google maps API
